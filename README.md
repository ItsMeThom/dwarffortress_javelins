# About

Adds Javelins and Javelin Throwers (Atlatl is the correct term) to the game.

Javelin Throwers can be carved from wood at a carpenters shop, or cast from metal at a metalsmith.

Javelins are cast from metal at the Metalsmith's Workshop by a weapon smith. There are two varieties,



- Light javelins, cast from Aluminum, Copper and Bronze.

- Heavy Javelins, cast from Iron, Steel Silver or Platinum.

  

  Javelins use the 'Spear' skill for ranged and melee combat (They will fight with the javelin thrower itself in close combat)

  The light javelins are around the same deadliness as crossbow bolts. The heavy javelins are more deadly, but are heavier (duh) so lugging a lot of them will slow down even the strong dwarf.

  Throwers and javelins are available to Dwarves, Humans, Elves, Goblins and Kobolds.

  Thanks to Mosesjns for the suggestion, and Meph and the Masterwork mod for the inspiration for javelins.

  In the future, on-character equipment for javelins will be added when I can.
